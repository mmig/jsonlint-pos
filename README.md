JSON Lint (LOC INFO)
=========

A modified version of the JavaScript [JSON parser](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint/) by Z. Carter.


MODIFICATION (russa)
----

Modified JSON parser which additionally extracts the position / location information
for the parsed JSON object.

Parser returns position information for parsed JSON objects, i.e.
the location within the input-string that is parsed.

Enable extraction of position information:
```javascript

var jsonlint = require("jsonlint");

//enable meta-data extraction:
jsonlint.setLocEnabled(true);

var data = jsonlint.parse('{"creative?": false}');

```

the result for parsed data object would be:
```javascript

// Index (in 3 lines)
//
//  2 4 6 8 10 13 16 19
// 1|3|5|7|9|11|14|17|20
// |||||||||||12|15|18|
// {"creative?": false}
//
// extracted meta data:
{
  "creative?": false,
  "_loc": {
    ///// location for whole object itself
    "first_line": 1,
    "last_line": 1,
    "first_column": 1,
    "last_column": 19,
    ///// location for property "creative?" in parent object
    "_creative?": [
      {//// position of property/name
        "first_line": 1,
        "last_line": 1,
        "first_column": 1,
        "last_column": 12
      },
      {//// position of property/value
        "first_line": 1,
        "last_line": 1,
        "first_column": 14,
        "last_column": 19
      }
    ],
    "_this": {///// location for object itself
      "first_line": 1,
      "last_line": 1,
      "first_column": 1,
      "last_column": 19
    }
  }
}
``` 

Position information is stored in property `"_loc"`.
Positions for properties are noted in the object's `"_loc"` in sub-property: `"_"+ property-name`
e.g.:
```javascript
{
  "_loc": {
    "_someProperty": {
            ...
```
             
Positions for array entries are noted in the array's `"_loc"` in sub-property: Â´"_"+ entry-index`
e.g.:
```javascript
{
  "_loc": {
    "_0": {
    "_1": {
            ...
```

The object's / array's own position is noted in `"_loc"` in sub-property `"_this"`
e.g.:
```javascript
{
  "_loc": {
    "_this": { ...
````

Each position/location information object has properties:
```javascript
{ 
  "first_line"   : NUMBER
  "last_line"    : NUMBER 
  "first_column" : NUMBER
  "last_column"  : NUMBER
}
```
